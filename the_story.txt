Once upon a time


It all started one rainy evening as Peter was banging away at their
CYGWIN_NT-6.1 computer's keyboard.
Some people didn't think the universe be like it is, but it do.
No copyright law in the universe can stop me! - he said.

You would never guess what happened next.
He began to eat it with great ferocity.
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.

The end.
