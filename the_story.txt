Once upon a time


It all started one rainy evening as Likexin was banging away at their Darwin
computer's keyboard. Talkin to his fellow gamers in a server of discord.

Playing some Overwatch, wrecking some noobs.
Some people didn't think the universe be like it is, but it do.
He decided to start his own frozen yogurt shop and call it Microsoft.
No copyright law in the universe can stop me! - he said."Why not?" the universe
replied.
There was a man named Sam. He loved universe so much.
A new day started
A day filled with sunshine and happiness.
Dragons were killing everyone
 Winter is comming, Nothing burns like the cold.


You would never guess what happened next.
A bird crashed through his basement window!
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
He began to eat it with great ferocity.
Chowing down on some pancakes and waffles.I was finally there to sit on my
throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
In other news, that's also why bears love honey.
How amazing!
There is no hope
What am I going to do next?
I decided to become the most wild breakdancer on the streets.

I will beat all the breakdancers.

The end.
