Once upon a time


It all started one rainy evening as Acmyf was banging away at their Linux
computer's keyboard. Talkin to his fellow gamers in a server of discord.

Some people didn't think the universe be like it is, but it do.
"Why not?" the universe replied.


You would never guess what happened next.
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
In other news, that's also why bears love honey.

The end.
