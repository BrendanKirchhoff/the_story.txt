Once upon a time


It all started one rainy evening as Michael was banging away at their Darwin
computer's keyboard. Talkin to his fellow gamers in a server of discord.

Playing some Overwatch, wrecking some noobs.
Some people didn't think the universe be like it is, but it do.
No copyright law in the universe can stop me! - he said.

You would never guess what happened next.
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
He began to eat it with great ferocity.
Chowing down on some pancakes and waffles.I was finally there to sit on my
throne as the Prince of Bel-Air

The end.
